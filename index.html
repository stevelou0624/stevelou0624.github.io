<p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>

    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: 

    <ol>
      <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
      <li>Magic City, ID</li>
      <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
      <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
      <li>Why, AZ</li>
      <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
    </ol>
    
      </p>
    
    <h3>July 14, 2012</h3>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: 

    <blockquote>Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity." </blockquote>

    I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
    
    <ol>
      <li>cell phone</li>
      <li><em>iPod</em></li>
      <li>digital camera</li>
      <li>protein bar</li>
    </ol>

    Just the essentials. As <strong>Lao Tzu</strong> would have said, 

    <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</q>
